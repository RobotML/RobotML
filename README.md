RobotML
=======

*RobotML* stands for Robot Modelling language.
It is semi-graphic language created in order to allow robotician to think of their problems without immediately thinking on what actual it will work.
It has been implemented in a platform based upon eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org) and papyrus.
This language has been defined through redaction of an ontology.

This project includes:
- RobotML Ontology package (named RobotML-ontology)
- Documentation of RobotML-ontology (text in OASIS format created using open office then libre office)
- Documentation of RobotML language (code is to be found in the RobotML-platform project)

Types of issues to be discussed in this project
- bugs / features requests for the ontology
