RobotML
=======

*RobotML* stands for Robot Modelling language.
It is semi-graphic language created in order to allow robotician to think of their problems without immediately thinking on what actual it will work.
It has been implemented in a platform based upon eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org) and papyrus.
This language has been defined through redaction of an ontology.
