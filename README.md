RobotML
=======

*RobotML* stands for Robot Modelling language.
It is semi-graphic language created in order to allow robotician to think of their problems without immediately thinking on what actual it will work. It is based upon a meta-model extracted / derived from an ontology which is presented here.
It has been implemented in a platform based upon eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org) and papyrus (http://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/). This development is not located anymore in this git project but directly as an extra-feature of the papyrus project (see 

This project includes:
- RobotML Ontology package (**Ontology** in the repository)
- Standardisation work (see **Standards** in the repository)
- Documents that may be used in the different discussions (**Documents** in the repository)

The **Export** folder in the repository is only used to host the *RobotML* ontology onto different formats (for the time being the turtle format is the only export format used).

Types of issues to be discussed in this project
- Definition of the concepts / properties that have to exist in order to describe the Robotic domain
- Definition of the concepts / properties to be translated in the semi graphic language (the DSL)
- Definition of the semi graphic language that is sometimes called the RobotML DSL from the above ontology elements (the meta model)
- bugs / features requests for the ontology
- features requests for the semi-graphic language and associated meta-model
